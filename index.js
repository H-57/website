let desc=[`"Ash Ketchum is finally ten years old; old enough to become a Pokémon Trainer. He wakes up late after accidentally destroying his alarm clock. He bumps into Gary Oak, grandson of the Pokémon expert, Professor Oak, who later shows Ash that all the Pokémon are gone. Ash has no choice but to take a naughty Pikachu, who won't listen to Ash because Pikachu chooses to stay outside of its Poké Ball, forcing Ash to drag it along with a rope. After many failed attempts at capturing some Pokémon, Ash throws a rock and hits a Spearow, who gets angry and calls an entire flock to chase Ash and Pikachu. They run away from the Spearow, in which Ash "borrows" a bike from a red-haired girl named Misty to escape, but when they cannot go any farther, Ash uses his body to shield Pikachu from the attacking Pokémon. Pikachu realizes how much Ash cares for him and uses a powerful electric attack to drive the Spearow away, destroying the bicycle and severely injuring Pikachu in the process as well. Ash and Pikachu see a glimpse of an unidentified Pokémon."`,`"Finally arriving in Viridian City, Ash is cornered by Officer Jenny, who asks why he is carrying Pikachu instead of having it in a Poké Ball. After explaining, Jenny takes Ash to the Pokémon Center, where Nurse Joy begins treatment on the injured Pikachu. Before Pikachu's treatment finishes, Misty, the girl who Ash took the bike from, confronts Ash for destroying her bicycle, and vows to stick with Ash until he compensates her for it. The Pokémon Center is then attacked by Jessie, James, and their talking Meowth; members of Team Rocket, a crime gang seeking to steal all of the infirm Pokémon. Ash's Pikachu recovers and joins the Pokémon Center's many Pikachu manage to defeat Team Rocket by shocking them using Thunder Shock."`,`"While walking through the Viridian Forest, Ash discovers and catches a Caterpie—his first Pokémon capture! Though Ash is excited, Misty is grossed out by Bug-type Pokémon, so she is repulsed by its attempts to be friends with her. At night, as Ash and Misty sleep, Caterpie shares with Pikachu its dream of evolving into a Butterfree. The next day, Ash also captures a Pidgeotto. However, Team Rocket shows up to steal Pikachu, weakening him and Pidgeotto in the process, so he reluctantly sends out Caterpie. To the surprise of Jessie and James—not to mention Ash—Caterpie's String Shot is able to defeat the Team Rocket Pokémon, including Meowth! When Misty tries to make nice with Caterpie, it evolves into a Metapod."`,`"A Samurai challenges Ash to a battle, and it turns out to be Metapod vs. Metapod. After a short time, a swarm of Beedrill attacks, and Ash's Metapod is taken by them. After learning to be more responsible of a trainer, Ash is able to rescue his Metapod, which subsequently evolves once more into Butterfree."`,`"Ash, Pikachu, and Misty have arrived at Pewter City, where Ash is eager to challenge Brock, the Pewter City Gym leader, to win the Boulder Badge. Brock is a strong Rock-type gym leader who easily defeats Ash. After meeting Flint, a mysterious man who sells rocks, Flint takes Ash and Pikachu to a watermill to make Pikachu stronger for the rematch, which Ash wins. It is revealed that Flint is none other than Brock's Dad. Afterwards, Brock decides to travel along with Ash and Misty as he wants to become world's best Pokémon breeder. He gives all the responsibilities of his siblings to his dad."`,`"Ash, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu arrive at Mt. Moon to find Team Rocket interfering with the local wildlife in hopes of finding the rare Moon Stone.

Also, Brock catches a Zubat."`,`"In his quest to collect Gym Badges, Ash heads for Cerulean City, intending to confront the Cerulean gym leader. For some reason, Misty expresses a desire to avoid Cerulean City and disappears along the way. Upon entering the gym, Ash and Pikachu are entranced by a synchronized swimming show being performed by three beautiful sisters, unsure if he has really found another Gym. The three sisters reveal that they are the gym leaders but have since converted the Gym into an aquarium and water show, and offer to just give Ash the Cascade Badge, but Misty appears once more, revealing that she is also one of the gym leaders and will battle Ash in lieu of her three older sisters. However, Team Rocket disrupts the battle in an attempt to steal all of the Gym's Pokémon. However, Ash and his Pokémon blast Team Rocket. The three sisters award Ash with the Cascade Badge for protecting the gym."`,`"Ash sets off triumphantly for Vermilion City. Along the way, they hear of a fierce trainer named A.J. (アキラ, Akira), who has never lost a match. Full of self-confidence from his own record of ten victories in a row, Ash heads directly for the gym to battle this new opponent."`,`"As Ash searches for firewood, he happens across a young boy being bullied by five classmates gathered around him. Eavesdropping on their conversation, Ash learns that the boys are attending a preparatory school for Pokémon trainers. Graduates from the school are automatically qualified to participate in the Pokémon League without traveling around and collecting any badges. Ash, Misty, and Brock head to the school and do not agree with some of their ideas of training, something their "leader" does not take well."`,`"Ash and friends are still lost along their way to Vermilion City. They stop by a pond for a break when they see an Oddish taking a drink. Ash and Misty try to catch it, but they are stopped by a Bulbasaur who rescues the Oddish. They continue on their journey and keep getting caught in traps, until the Bulbasaur's owner, Melanie (ミドリ, Midori), saves them and brings them back to her cabin. It turns out that she helps injured, sick, and abandoned Pokémon, and they decide to help. Meanwhile, Team Rocket decides to steal all the Pokémon, while Brock wonders if he should stay with Melanie. In the end, Melanie gives Bulbasaur to Ash, but not until Bulbasaur challenges Ash and Pikachu to a battle."`,`"Ash, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu come across a Charmander sitting on a rock. Ash tries to catch it, but it turns out it has a trainer and cannot be captured, so they head to the Pokémon Center, unaware that they would meet Damian (ダイスケ, Daisuke), a hotshot trainer who brags about leaving the Charmander behind on a false promise to come back for it, when he meant to abandon it for being weak. The gang hurries to rescue Charmander amidst severe weather, but Charmander returns to where he was abandoned, and eventually decides to join Ash after saving Pikachu from being abducted by Team Rocket."`,`"Ash, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu become the victims of pranks played by a gang of Squirtle known as the Squirtle Squad. They end up falling down a hole and are even eventually captured by them. It turns out that they are working together with Team Rocket. When Pikachu is severely injured, the Squirtle lets Ash out to get medicine from town but must return soon or his friends will be trapped by the Squirtle Squad forever. In the end, the Squirtle Squad saves the town from a fire started by Team Rocket and the lead Squirtle of the squad joins Ash on his further adventures."`,`"When a Krabby that Ash catches disappears, he goes to a nearby lighthouse to see if it reached Professor Oak's lab. The keeper of the lighthouse is Bill, a Pokémon researcher who is searching for a mysterious Pokémon that sometimes appears by his lighthouse.

Injured, the Pokémon loses its trust of Bill and vanishes forever, though Bill intends to keep an eye out in case it ever appears again."`,`"Ash finally arrives in Vermilion City and is ready to prove that he can defeat its gym leader, Lt. Surge, along with the leader's Raichu. However, Ash discovers that many trainers nearly lost their Pokémon to defeat Lt. Surge, who taunts Ash for not evolving his Pikachu. Ash must train his Pikachu's speed to defeat Lt. Surge and win the Thunder Badge."`,`"Ash wins a ticket to take a trip on a luxury cruise ship, the St. Anne. Ash enjoys the journey, even trading Butterfree for a Raticate, but feels guilty afterwards and asks for Butterfree back. However, the whole cruise is a scheme devised by Team Rocket, who plans to steal the Pokémon of all the trainers on board. During the confusion, James purchases a Magikarp from a devious salesman, under the impression it will make him rich, unaware of Magikarp's true nature. After Team Rocket's plans fail, the St. Anne is hit by a powerful storm. Ash loses his Butterfree's Poké Ball in the confusion and goes to get it, just as James tries to retrieve Magikarp's Poké Ball, and both groups are knocked unconscious while the rest of the passengers escape safely."`,`"Ash, Misty, Brock, and Pikachu wake up aboard the St. Anne, discovering it has capsized and sank. Elsewhere, Jessie, James, and Meowth wake up as well, and in an attempt to escape only flood the area that they are in. When Ash and his friends find Team Rocket, the group decides to put their differences aside to escape safely, after an attempted battle nearly causes the ship to sink farther. After traversing the ship, they find a weak part of the hull to escape from, using Misty and Ash's water Pokémon to escape, while Team Rocket uses James' Magikarp, unaware that it cannot swim. After making it to the surface on some debris, the group discovers Team Rocket, once more, and after a day stranded, decide to eat Magikarp, only discovering that it has no meat on it. In anger, James kicks Magikarp off the raft and it evolves into Gyarados. It calls a group of other Gyarados to attack the group by forming a water cyclone, and everyone is stranded once more."`,`"After being hit by a Dragon Rage attack from James' newly evolved Gyarados while at sea, the humans are separated from their Pokémon on an island that is inhabited by giant Pokémon.

After destroying an old man's ship, they must help in the old man's business. To attempt to pay the man back faster, Misty enters a beauty contest, only to discover she is competing against Jessie and James.

It did not air until June 24, 2000 on Kids' WB, albeit with all suggestive scenes edited."`,`"Stuck in Porta Vista because they missed the boat, Ash and friends sit around waiting for the next boat and witness a great explosion, later discovering that a group of Tentacool and Tentacruel are attacking the city since construction is destroying their reef.

Ash asks Haunter for help to defeat Sabrina but Haunter disappears during the match. Brock and Misty get turned into dolls, and Ash is rescued just in time by the mysterious man. The man (who is really Sabrina's father) reveals that Sabrina has two personalities – one of the cold and unfeeling trainer, the other of the repressed little girl, who also turned her mother into a doll. The only way to defeat Sabrina is to make her smile again. During the next match, Haunter suddenly appears in front of Sabrina while Kadabra and Pikachu are battling.
